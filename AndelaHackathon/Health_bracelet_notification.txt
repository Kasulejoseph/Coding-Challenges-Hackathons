A health bracelet has a formula for alerting the user about their workout progress. If the number of miles ran is 2x the median distance for a trailing number of days, they send the user a notification about their progress. No notifications are generated before a given number of days data is collected.

Given the number of trailing days d and the user’s workout for a period of n days, find and print the number of times the user will receive a notification over all n days.

For example, d=3 and distances=[1,2,3,4,5]. On the first three days, they just collect workout data. On day 4, we have trailing distances of [1,2,3]. The median is 2 and the day's distance covered is 4. Because 4 ≥ 2 x 2, there will be a notification. The next day, our trailing distances are [2,3,4] and the distance covered is 5 . This is less than 2 x 3 so no notification will be sent. Over the period, there was one notification.

Complete the function activityAlerts in the editor below. It must return an integer representing the number of client notifications.

Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers n and d, the number of days of transaction data, and the number of trailing days' data used to calculate median spending. The second line contains n space-separated non-negative integers where each integer i denotes distances[i].

Constraints

1 ≤ n ≤ 2 x 105
1 ≤ d ≤ n
0 ≤ expenditures[i] ≤ 200
Output Format

Print an integer denoting the total number of notifications received in n days.

There are 4 days of data required so the first day a notification might go out is day 5. Our trailing data is [1,2,3,4] with a median of 2.5. The user runs for 5 miles and since 5≥2x2.5 a notification is generated. On day 6, our trailing data is [2,3,4,5] with a median of 3.5 and the user covers 6 miles. Since 6<2x3.5, no notification is sent. Therefore only 1 notification is sent during the time period.

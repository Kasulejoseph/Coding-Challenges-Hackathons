You are given a binary string s of size n containing only 0s and 1s. 
A substring of size k is called good if the count of all 1s in this substring is not greater than m.

You are required to transform a string in such a manner that every substring of size k are good by performing some operations. 
In one operation, you can change the value of a character in a string from 1 to 0.

Determine the minimum number of operations that are required such that every substring of size k in the given string is good.

Input format

First line: Three space-separated integers n, k, and m
Second line: Binary string s of size n
Output format

First line: Print a single integer that denotes the minimum number of operations that are required.
Second line: Print the strings that are transformed after applying the operations. 
If there are multiple such strings, then you can print any of them.


Explanation
The minimum operations required is 2.

Operations: convert s[2] to 0 then convert s[8] to 0.
Now the string becomes 110000110011 where all substrings of size 4 are good.

The string 101000110011 also may be the answer because here also all the substrings of size 4 are good.
Operations: convert s[1] to 0 then convert s[8] to 0.

8, 4, 2
11111111

Ans 
4
